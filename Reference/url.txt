10_Compositional GAN 
- This approach is only limited to a fixed background and does not consider 
   more complex interatctions in the real world
- One key insight is to reformulate the problem of composition of two obejcts 
  into first composing the given object images to generate the joint combined 
  image which models the object interaction, 
  and then decomposing the joint image back to obtain individual ones.

 (a) paired: when we have access to paired examples of individual
object images with their corresponding composed image, 
 (b) unpaired: when we have a dataset from
the joint distribution without being paired with any of the images 
from the marginal distributions
